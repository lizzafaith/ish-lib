But one of the most popular destinations in Cambodia is the city of Siem Reap located in the northern part of the country.\r\n\r\nYou can easily get there, as modern international airport is located near the city. Just a short ride and you will get directly into one of Siem Reap hotels. There all types of properties \u00c2\u2013 from small and cheap for budget travelers to luxurious boutique hotels for those guests who prefer comfortable stay.\r\n\r\nWhichever kind of traveler you are, it is guaranteed that you will find something for your own. The most popular and visited site is, of course, Angkor Wat temple city. This architectural complex is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Being built in the medieval times, when Khmer Empire reached its peak, Angkor Wat (or \u00c2\u2018Temple City\u00c2\u2019) is a large and complicated complex which has numerous temples. But the most significant one is a Wat Phnom which is the biggest temple at once. It is more then 3 sq km big, surrounded by a moat and with a couple of towers. Entire walls and roof are decorated with hand carved stone monuments that represent all imaginable pieces of Hindu mythology.\r\n\r\nIt was rediscovered in the beginning of the 20th century by a group of French travelers and scientist. From that time, excluding war periods, this place is extremely popular. Its territory is surrounded by a forest which is not cleared as there is a consensus that ruins must stay in the same conditions as they were found.\r\n\r\nThere are also many interesting places to visit in the city. For example, you can buy a pair of tickets and enjoy national dance Apsara. Or visit National Museum and study main frames of Cambodian history. Some more details about the latter can be explored in the Cambodian Cultural Village that is a kind of museum as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to deepen into Cambodian way of life, visit Old Market which is located in the very center of the city. Here you can find many valuable goods which will serve you for a long time. For example, there are great hand made silk products and other items of a kind. Festival lovers will be pleased with rain festival that takes place every year. At the same time, you can have a tour to Tonle Sap Lake and see how people live in floating village.","id":13721,"inappropriate_count":0,"is_anonymous":false,"is_done":0,"is_feature":1,"is_outsource":false,"is_public":1,"is_trash":0,"issue_id":null,"name":"Travel to Siem Reap","name_seo":"travel-to-siem-reap","photo_content_type":"image/jpeg","photo_file_name":"siemreap_a.jpg","photo_file_size":82382,"photo_updated_at":"2011-10-21T02:33:18Z","rating_denominator":0,"rating_numerator":0,"recommended":[{"active_at":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","address":null,"cities_user_id":null,"city_id":null,"created_at":"2011-04-28T00:00:00Z","day_id":null,"descr":"<p>Chicago is known as the Windy City and it`s true: the winds here sometimes get to you. On some holidays like New Year`s Ewe and Thanksgiving, it is even hard to ride a motorcycle because the wind tries to knock you out of your seat. But you learn to lean with the wind. In general however, I would say that what Chicagoans and visitors say is true: in the summer, Chicago is great. In the winter, it`s cold and generally unpleasant. If you absolutely do not tolerate cold, please do not relocate ;-)<br /><br />During the summer the number of festivities in Chicago is over the top. There are street parties more than once per week. They are all on the weekends, and there are two or three street festivals going on every weekend during summers in Chicago. See Taste of Chicago, and Taste of Lincoln Park, Taste of Wicker Park as examples.<br /><br />One of the biggest events of the summer is Lollapalooza. If you have not, perhaps you should consider buying your tickets already ;-) Lolla attracts millions of people every year. In 2011, the event will happen August 5th through 7th in Grant Park.<br /><br />The club selection in Chicago is pretty good. Not on par with New York, San Francisco or Miami---but, in the minds of many (myself included), clubs in Chicago are pretty good. If you are a beginner in the club scene, you should consider the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Spy Bar</li>\r\n<li>Vision</li>\r\n<li>Smart Bar</li>\r\n<li>Sound Bar - the Metro</li>\r\n<li>Crescendo</li>\r\n<li>Crobar was good but it closed</li>\r\n<li>Green Dolphin experienced a game over in 2010 as well, too bad </li>\r\n<li>Empty Bottle</li>\r\n<li>Debonair</li>\r\n<li>Congress Theater</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br />Additionally, if you like the Party, check our the 6-corner center of Wicker Park, it's really really good.<br /><br />In the next article I will give a more in-depth analysis of party venues in Chicago and explain why some are better than others, and why some people will prefer some clubs better than others.
