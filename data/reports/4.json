Over one-third of the city population is concentrated in  the lakefront neighborhoods (from Rogers Park in the north to South  Shore in the south). The city has many upscale dining establishments as  well as many ethnic restaurant districts. These include the Mexican  villages, such as Pilsen on 18th street and La Villita on 26th street,  the Puerto Rican enclave Paseo Boricua in the Humboldt Park  neighborhood, \"Greektown\" on South Halsted, \"Little Italy\" on Taylor  Street, just west of Halsted, \"Chinatown\" on the near South Side, Polish  fare reigns at Belmont-Central, \"Little Seoul\" on and around Lawrence  Avenue, a cluster of Vietnamese restaurants on Argyle Street and South  Asian (Indian/Pakistani) on Devon Avenue.<br /><br />Downtown is the center  of Chicago's cultural, commercial and financial institutions, and home  to Grant Park and many of the city's skyscapers. Many of the city's  financial institutions (for example,, CBOT, Chicago Fed) are located  within a section of downtown called \"The Loop\", which is an eight block  by five block square of city streets that are encircled by elevated rail  tracks. The name \"The Loop\" is sometimes also used to refer to the  entire downtown area. The central area often is portrayed, as in the map  at right, to include parts of Near North Side and Near South Side, as  well as the Loop. These areas contribute famous skyscrapers, shopping,  museums, a stadium for the Chicago Bears and convention facilities.  Similarly, the area just west of the Loop and the Chicago River  contributes to the commercial core.<br /><br />The North Side contains  Lincoln Park, a 1,200-acre (490 ha) park stretching for 5.5 mi (8.9 km)  along the waterfront with the Lincoln Park Zoo and the Lincoln Park  Conservatory. The River North neighborhood features the nation's largest  concentration of contemporary art galleries outside of New York City.  As a Polonia center, due to the city having a very large Polish  population, Chicago celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of  Polonia Festival in the Jefferson Park area.[48] The Chicago Cubs play  in the North Side's Wrigleyville. Two North Side neighborhoods in  particular, Lakeview and the Andersonville area of the Edgewater  neighborhood, are home to many LGBT businesses and organizations. The  area surrounding the North Side intersections of Halsted, Belmont, and  Clark is a gay district known as \"Boystown.\"<br /><br />The South Side is  home to the University of Chicago, and the Museum of Science and  Industry. It also hosts one of the city's largest parades, the annual  African American Bud Billiken Day parade. Burnham Park stretches along  the waterfront of the South Side. Two of the city's largest parks are  located here: Jackson Park, bordering the waterfront, hosted the World's  Columbian Exposition in 1893 and is home of the aforementioned museum;  slightly west sits Washington Park. U.S. automaker, Ford Motor Company,  has an assembly plant located on the South Side. Also, most of the  facilities of the Port of Chicago are here. The Chicago White Sox play  at 35th Street.<br /><br />The West Side holds the Garfield Park  Conservatory, one of the largest collections of tropical plants of any  US city. Prominent Latino cultural attractions found here include  Humboldt Park's Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Puerto Rican Day  Parade, as well as the National Museum of Mexican Art and St. Adalbert's  Church in Pilsen. The Near West Side holds the television production  company of Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios and the University of Illinois  at Chicago. The Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks call the West Side  home at the United Center sports arena.</p>","id":13606,"inappropriate_count":0,"is_anonymous":false,"is_done":0,"is_feature":1,"is_outsource":false,"is_public":1,"is_trash":0,"issue_id":null,"name":"Things to do in Chicago","name_seo":"Things_to_do_in_Chicago","photo_content_type":"image/jpeg","photo_file_name":"wickerpark1.jpg","photo_file_size":236345,"photo_updated_at":"2011-10-21T02:31:32Z","rating_denominator":0,"rating_numerator":0,"recommended":[{"active_at":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","address":null,"cities_user_id":null,"city_id":null,"created_at":"2011-04-28T00:00:00Z","day_id":null,"descr":"<p>Chicago is known as the Windy City and it`s true: the winds here sometimes get to you. On some holidays like New Year`s Ewe and Thanksgiving, it is even hard to ride a motorcycle because the wind tries to knock you out of your seat. But you learn to lean with the wind. In general however, I would say that what Chicagoans and visitors say is true: in the summer, Chicago is great. In the winter, it`s cold and generally unpleasant. If you absolutely do not tolerate cold, please do not relocate ;-)<br /><br />During the summer the number of festivities in Chicago is over the top. There are street parties more than once per week. They are all on the weekends, and there are two or three street festivals going on every weekend during summers in Chicago. See Taste of Chicago, and Taste of Lincoln Park, Taste of Wicker Park as examples.<br /><br />One of the biggest events of the summer is Lollapalooza. If you have not, perhaps you should consider buying your tickets already ;-) Lolla attracts millions of people every year. In 2011, the event will happen August 5th through 7th in Grant Park.<br /><br />The club selection in Chicago is pretty good. Not on par with New York, San Francisco or Miami---but, in the minds of many (myself included), clubs in Chicago are pretty good. If you are a beginner in the club scene, you should consider the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Spy Bar</li>\r\n<li>Vision</li>\r\n<li>Smart Bar</li>\r\n<li>Sound Bar - the Metro</li>\r\n<li>Crescendo</li>\r\n<li>Crobar was good but it closed</li>\r\n<li>Green Dolphin experienced a game over in 2010 as well, too bad </li>\r\n<li>Empty Bottle</li>\r\n<li>Debonair</li>\r\n<li>Congress Theater</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br />Additionally, if you like the Party, check our the 6-corner center of Wicker Park, it's really really good.<br /><br />In the next article I will give a more in-depth analysis of party venues in Chicago and explain why some are better than others, and why some people will prefer some clubs better than others.

Many buildings in there are done in electrical mix of colonial French architecture and local traditions.

Being built in the medieval times, when Khmer Empire reached its peak, Angkor Wat (or \u00c2\u2018Temple City\u00c2\u2019) is a large and complicated complex which has numerous temples. But the most significant one is a Wat Phnom which is the biggest temple at once. It is more then 3 sq km big, surrounded by a moat and with a couple of towers. Entire walls and roof are decorated with hand carved stone monuments that represent all imaginable pieces of Hindu mythology.\r\n\r\nIt was rediscovered in the beginning of the 20th century by a group of French travelers and scientist. From that time, excluding war periods, this place is extremely popular. Its territory is surrounded by a forest which is not cleared as there is a consensus that ruins must stay in the same conditions as they were found.\r\n\r\nThere are also many interesting places to visit in the city. For example, you can buy a pair of tickets and enjoy national dance Apsara. Or visit National Museum and study main frames of Cambodian history. Some more details about the latter can be explored in the Cambodian Cultural Village that is a kind of museum as well.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to deepen into Cambodian way of life, visit Old Market which is located in the very center of the city. Here you can find many valuable goods which will serve you for a long time. For example, there are great hand made silk products and other items of a kind. Festival lovers will be pleased with rain festival that takes place every year.

This man might like parties and belong to a good family, because he brought a 2500cc high range Nissan, important data.\r\n\r\nWithout entering in details about how good was the party, let\u2019s go straight to the matter. At he end of the night, we took the girls to their house, and while they jumped out of the car, remaining Rodrigo and me inside, a police from a patrol, that had followed us the last meters without apparent reason, that surely would come to request a \u201ctip\u201d, approached to us. We said goodbye to our friends and meanwhile at the window there was the policeman hoping to speak with us. We were acting as if there was nobody at all and finally, when Rodrigo said goodbye to the last girl, then he looked with absolute serenity at the police, who was a little pissed off of waiting, and said \u201cYes, agent?\u201d, and... accelerated! What happened next was the typical thing that you may deduce: a persecution at full speed at 4am through the streets of Mexico DF. What a fucking madness!! , like in a movie with the police in behind, turning in each corner, the wheels hissing in each curve, and Danielito there, hallucinating in the passenger\u2019s seat with a guy that knew just from some hours ago. I still remember Rodrigo\u2019s face with a victory look shouting \"\u00a1Great, we did it!\", after loosing them from sight, but quickly the red and blue blinking lights reappeared in the mirror. I suggested to him to park and switch off the lights as soon as we loose them again, but he preferred to run. As it is logical, the traffic lights were not our priority and the circulation direction wasn\u2019t either. That was generating several problems, first that thanks to the scandal we were producing we were recruiting more police to our \u201cquiet\u201d procession, and second, that the intersections were really exciting and a potential danger. In one of those intersections, a taxi was crossing and with good reflex we avoided it just for few centimetres. We arrived at another one and there was a pick-up coming. I saw it and thought, instead of with preoccupation, with resignation, \u201cfinally we are going to crash\u201d, assuming that sooner or later it must happen, ...and it happened. We crashed with the corners of the cars and due to the velocity we bounced and hit the backsides as well.\r\n\r\nWe were a little bit in a rush, because I wanted to visit many things the next morning ;), so we accelerated again and kept going with our calm nocturnal walk at full speed. The problem now was that a car with twisted axis doesn\u2019t go very straight and we were following a perfect line, a perfect zigzag line almost crashing in every bend. We only reached to cross one more a street. Before we parked in a street in opposite direction, Rodrigo said to me \u201cRun, dude, as soon as we stop open the door and run!\u201d, \u201cbut you are crazy?, where the fuck am I gonna go, the Seventh of Cavalry is chasing us!\u201d We stopped, evidently we did not run, and immediately afterwards there were like four motorbikes and three cars. By recent previous experiences with the police, I thought that we were going to be treated not very gently after what we had done, which I consider was quite deserved, but instead of being aimed with twenty handguns and five shortguns, as it would happened in the United States, a police approached calmly to Rodrigo, who had already left the car and was walking towards the police, and said to him \u201cBut, why have you done it, wey?\u201d, \u201cI was an asshole, just that\u201d, he answered at the time he took his hands to the head in gesture of \u201cwhat a silly mistake\u201d. Nobody was exalted, but my legs were trembling, and that situation seemed completely surrealistic to me. Immediately Rodrigo said to the police \u201clet\u2019s see how can we solve this\u201d, and he went to a corner with three policemen to speak, while I walked around with nobody paying attention to me, except for some police or spontaneous people that eventually came to me to gossip about what had happened, but nothing to do with testimonies and declarations.\r\n\r\nThe pick-up, which was quite fucked up and was losing oil, had arrived in the meantime. The police agreed that the drivers had to solve the problem themselves, and if they wouldn\u2019t understand each other, then Rodrigo would have had to go to jail. The man of the pick-up was surprising quiet, when the normal thing would have been to directly smash the Rodrigo\u2019s head, but he behaved very well and after a couple of hours they already reached an agreement. Another little detail was that none of them had the insurance in order.\r\n\r\nIn the while the drivers were talking, the police were just watching like me and nothing more, so they started to get bored and leave, except two of them. Rodrigo went a while in the car with them to an ATM to get some money to pay the police for the \u201cinconveniences\u201d.\r\n\r\nOne of them was a bastard and eventually, while I was speaking very friendly with his buddy about Spain and my stories, he came to me saying that since I was also in the car they would have to take me detained. Evidently he was trying to scare me to take some money from me as well. I understood perfectly what he wanted and laughed as if he was joking and didn\u2019t felt in the trap. He tried it a couple of times more, but I always acted the same. What a bastard!\r\n\r\nAfter long time there I was willing to go home, but I didn\u2019t have money, so I requested to the policemen to take me home, but the son of a bitch refused it. The funny thing is that at the end I get the money for the taxi from the one of the pick-up!\r\n\r\nExcept for my dairy and this text (and its Spanish version), there is no written evidence of what happened that night. In fact, the pick-up\u2019s driver said to the police that if he would have any problem, they were witnesses; they responded to him \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have any evidence\u201d.\r\n\r\n...Amazing Mexico.","id":13749,"inappropriate_count":0,"is_anonymous":false,"is_done":0,"is_feature":0,"is_outsource":false,"is_public":1,"is_trash":0,"issue_id":null,"name":"Amazing Mexico","name_seo":"Amazing_Mexico-RTAXL","photo_content_type":"image/png","photo_file_name":"Screen shot 2011-12-21 at 1.05.54 PM.png","photo_file_size":519630,"photo_updated_at":"2011-12-21T21:08:41Z","rating_denominator":0,"rating_numerator":0,"subhead":" On April 10th in M\u00e9xico DF, your favourite traveller ;) harvested one of the best anecdotes of his trip.","updated_at":"2011-12-21T21:08:41Z","user_id":1,"x":null,"y":null}],"subhead":"Chicago, IL is a major city in midwest, providing an economic, financial and entertainment hub to millions of people.","updated_at":"2011-08-29T00:00:00Z","user_id":1,"videos":[],"x":null,"y":null}
